I've adapted this Plugin from "[2010 Summary](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/2010-summary/) by Tomasz Topa"

This plugin generates a brief summary of your blog for year 2012.

See how many posts you wrote during the ending year, which were the most popular, who was the most active commenter etc.

And then share the stats with your readers - copy the data to a new draft with a single click.
